<hr class="half-width">
<p>Intellectual property (IP) is a general term referring to intangible
creations of human intellect. There are multiple types of IP recognized
in law in most jurisdictions. The types that are most often associated
with software include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Copyright</strong> grants the creator of an original work
(e.g., a software package) exclusive rights to its use and distribution,
including limits on derivative works.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>patent</strong> grants the inventor of something new,
useful, and non-obvious (which may be embodied in software) the rights
to its production, use, and distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>trademark</strong> is a sign, design, or expression
which identifies products or services from a particular source (e.g.,
your software), as distinguished from other sources.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Licenses</strong> are a legal tool to transfer (selected)
rights in a work, invention, or mark (forms of intellectual property)
from one party to another. When we talk about licenses for software,
we’re primarily focused on copyright. But some software licenses include
clauses pertaining to patents and trademarks related to that
software.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Under the law, the software you write is subject to <strong>copyright
on creation</strong>. You don’t have to do anything special to claim
copyright.</p>
<p>Normally, the creator of the work owns the copyright in the work. But
it is “work for hire” (i.e., as part of your job), often the employer
will own the copyright. Employment contracts often make IP rights
explicit. If your employer owns the copyright, you probably have to get
formal permission to license and distribute your software.</p>
<p>Unless you specify some license for your software, all rights in the
software are reserved to the copyright owner.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As we’ve mentioned, licenses provide a means to convey selected
rights from the owner of those rights to others. Different licenses can
be defined that convey different rights. You can think of software
licenses as spanning a spectrum.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/license-spectrum2.png" alt="Software licenses span a spectrum of possibilities depending on what rights they convey to the licensee." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>At one extreme, all rights are reserved to the owner of the
copyright. This is the situation that applies when you do not specify a
license, but it is also common to see “All rights reserved” stated
explicitly as a form of license.</p>
<p>Proprietary licenses, also referred to as closed-source licenses,
typically convey rights to use the software but reserve rights to access
or distribute the source code. Software that is distributed under a
proprietary license is most often provided in the form of an executable,
though in some cases, licensees may receive the source code (e.g., so
that they can build it on platforms that the copyright owner may not
have access to), but be restricted from redistributing it.</p>
<p>Free or open licenses generally convey more rights to the licensee,
typically including access to the source code and the right to
redistribute it. Within the range of open licenses, they can be broadly
categorized as “copyleft” or “permissive”. We’ll take a deeper look at
open licenses in the next episode.</p>
<p>At the other extreme of the licensing spectrum is the public domain,
which is not so much a license as a disclaimer of all rights in the
work. Works in the public domain do not have a copyright or a copyright
holder. Anyone can do whatever they want with such works.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Licenses play an important role for both developers and users of
software. The license provides guidance as to how developers can
contribute to the software and how users can approach using it.</p>
<p>Developers should expect that their contributions to the code base
will be licensed on the same terms as the original work (unless other
arrangements are made). With closed-source licenses, the developer may
lose subsequent access to their contributions once they are subsumed
into the proprietary code base. Open source licenses, on the other hand,
provide for access to the source code and the ability to redistribute
the code. Developers contributing to open-source projects can therefore
expect ongoing access to their contributions and the ability to
redistribute the code.</p>
<p>The user’s perspective is somewhat similar. With a proprietary
license, they are likely to be limited to using executables that the
copyright holder chooses to make available. If the source code is not
available, the user has no way of understanding what the code is
actually doing. Open-source licenses, on the other hand, ensure the
availability of the source code, and so the user’s ability to (try to)
build the software on different computer platforms. The user can review
the code to see what it is doing when it is run. While there may well be
helpful user communities in either case, the fact that everyone in the
community has access to the source code of an open-source package may
make it more likely that the user can obtain assistance from people
besides the copyright holder.</p>

influence your decision about pursuing a collaboration?</p>
<p>If they mention that the software is open source, would that
influence your decision about pursuing a collaboration?</p>

<p>Ultimately, the choice of how to license your software should be
thought of as a <em>tool</em> in pursuing the greater goals of your
software and your project.</p>

<p>Open source is a popular choice in scientific research, for reasons
we’ll explore in the next episode. But before that, let’s take a deeper
look at what we mean by “open source” and some nuances in the spectrum
of open-source software licenses.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-major-names-in-open-source">The major names in open source<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-major-names-in-open-source"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>When it comes to defining open-source or free software, there are two
major organizations to be aware of. The <a href="https://fsf.org" class="external-link">Free
Software Foundation</a> (FSF) was founded in 1985 by Richard Stallman.
In addition to advocacy for free software <a href="https://fsf.org/licensing" class="external-link">licensing</a>, the FSF also maintains a
sizable number of software products, including GNU Emacs and many of the
packages at the core of the GNU/Linux operating system.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://opensource.org/" class="external-link">Open Source Initiative</a>
(OSI) was founded in 1998 by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens. The primary
mission of the OSI is to assess licenses and maintain a list of those
which they judge to qualify as “open source.” They also engage in
advocacy related to open-source software.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="free-vs-open-source">“Free” vs “open source”<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#free-vs-open-source"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>It may not be surprising, given their names, that the Free Software
Foundation tends to use the term “free software”, whereas the Open
Source Initiative prefers “open source.” Although the FSF uses the term
“free” in licensing discussions to refer to the freedom to do certain
things with the software, the term often gets conflated with “free” as
in no cost, which quickly muddles the discussion. Hence, some prefer to
use the term “open source” for clarity. You may also see the term
“libre” (Spanish for “free”) used in place of or together with “free”
(i.e., “free/libre”) in the context of software.</p>
<p>This lesson generally uses the term “open source.”</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="defining-free-software-the-four-freedoms">Defining free software: The four freedoms<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#defining-free-software-the-four-freedoms"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The FSF has a concise <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms" class="external-link">definition
of free software</a> that revolves around the freedom to do certain
things with the software:</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The freedom to <strong>run the program</strong> for any
purpose.</li>
<li>The freedom to <strong>study how the program works</strong>, and
<strong>change it</strong> so it does your computing as you wish.</li>
<li>The freedom to <strong>redistribute copies</strong> so you can help
your neighbor.</li>
<li>The freedom to <strong>distribute copies of your modified
versions</strong> to others. By doing this you can give the whole
community a chance to benefit from your changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that <strong>access to the source code</strong> is a
precondition for freedoms 1-3.</p>
<p>The OSI has a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd/" class="external-link">definition of
open source</a> software which is longer but amounts to the same thing
for most purposes. The OSI definition includes two requirements that are
implicit in the FSF freedom 0, but which are worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>No discrimination against persons or groups, and</li>
<li>No discrimination against fields of endeavor.</li>
</ul></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="permissive-vs-copyleft-open-source-licenses">Permissive vs copyleft open-source licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#permissive-vs-copyleft-open-source-licenses"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of the most important distinctions in the spectrum of open-source
software licenses is whether they are considered “copyleft” (also called
“restrictive”) or “permissive.” These terms have to do with how the
license treats derivative works (which we’ll define more thoroughly in a
few moments).</p>
<p>A permissive license allows the licensee to distribute derivative
works as they see fit. This includes the possibility of relicensing the
derivative work under another license, possibly even a proprietary
license. Examples of permissive licenses include the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/" class="external-link">Apache License</a>,
the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/" class="external-link">BSD
License</a>, and the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit/" class="external-link">MIT
License</a>.</p>
<p>Copyleft licenses, on the other hand, require that the licensee
distribute derivative works under the same license as the original work.
The FSF is one of the main proponents of copyleft licenses, and they
created two of the most widely used examples: the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0/" class="external-link">GNU General Public
License</a> (GPL) and the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/lgpl-3-0/" class="external-link">GNU Lesser General
Public License</a> (LGPL).</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="what-is-a-derivative-work">What is a derivative work?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-a-derivative-work"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Wikipedia tells us that <em>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work" class="external-link">derivative work</a>
is an expressive creation that includes major copyright-protected
elements of a previously created first work.</em> For software, this
amounts to modifications to someone else’s software. So derivative works
are extremely common, especially in collaborative software
development.</p>
<p>But what about linking to a library? (And does it matter whether the
linkage is static or dynamic?) Or software that interacts via pipes? Or
software that is used as a component in a coupled multiphyscs
application? Are these also modifications to someone else’s software?
Opinions differ on such questions. The Free Software Foundation’s GPL
license considers everything in a single executable to be a derived
work. (The GPL is sometimes referred to as a “viral” license because it
“infects” everything that “touches” it.) The key difference between the
GPL and the LGPL is that the latter says that linking is <em>not</em>
considered a derivative work. The FSF refers to the GPL as “strong
copyleft” or “strongly protective” (of software freedom) and the LGPL as
a weakened version. The definition of derivative work matters less for
permissive licenses because they are not so rigidly tied to the license
of the original work.</p>
<p>But because of these different approaches to dealing with derivative
works, concerns about the “compatibility” of licenses may arise when you
are combining software under different licenses. A later episode will
explore this in greater detail, but for now, the easiest way to avoid
problems with license compatibility is to avoid <em>distributing</em>
other works with yours. In other words, don’t ship someone else’s
software package as part of yours. (Some may consider it a convenience
to bundle together all of the dependencies required to build a software
package.) Let the end user put them together (i.e., build the executable
that combines them).</p>
<p>This is because of an important fact about open source licenses, even
strong copyleft licenses: you’re not required to distribute a derived
work! The requirement is that <em>if</em> you do distribute it, you do
so in conformance with the terms of the license of the original work. So
you can make changes to a piece of software and you’re not required to
share the derived work with anyone else. And you can finesse license
compatibility issues by letting the end user put everything together
rather than you shipping the combined work.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the licensing of your dependencies, there
are numerous paid and free automated tools to check for license
compatibility. However, you are ultimately responsible for ensuring
license compatibility and passing a tool check does necessarily mean you
have no conflicts (though a failing check should be addressed!).</p>

<p>No. Clauses 1 (especially) violate the freedom of being able to
modify the code and the freedom to distribute copies of your modified
version of the code to others. And clause 2 requires that if you
distribute copies of the <em>unmodified</em> original, it is under the
same license terms.</p>
<p>Why might someone have felt clauses like these were necessary to
include in their software license? Perhaps they’ve had problems in the
past with users distributing modified code with errors that they felt
reflected poorly on the original code. Or perhaps they want to impose
some measure of quality control over modifications.</p>
<p>A possible alternative solution would be to include a requirement
that derivatives must be clearly distinguished from the original (e.g.,
different name). Some open source licenses include such clauses.</p>

<p>It seems like clauses 3 and 4, charitably interpreted, are intended
to give the copyright owner awareness of how people are using the
software. Going back to our speculation about why they might not want
anyone to modify the code, perhaps they’re implicitly seeking to exert
some quality control over work done using the code. If you send them a
draft paper, do you think they would let you know if they found a
problem with how you had used the code or interpreted the results?</p>
<p>Clause 5 is a requirement that the code be cited in work where it is
used. This probably seems quite reasonable, on its face – appropriate
citation of software should be encouraged. There are other ways to make
this request, though they lack the legal force of putting it in the
license. The primary alternative is to make the request in a prominent
file in the repository. <code>CITATION</code> is the conventional name
for this file, though some people put it in the <code>README</code>
file. The <a href="https://citation-file-format.github.io/" class="external-link">Citation
File Format</a> (CFF) is a lightly structured YAML schema, designed to
be both human- and machine-readable, to indicate your preferred citation
for the work. These files are conventionally named
<code>CITATION.cff</code> and in addition to be being readily visible in
your repository can be interpreted by tools like GitHub, Zenodo, and
Zotero to automatically display the preferred citation.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>OSI approves open-source licenses for <em>software.</em> But there
are many other creative works related to software (or not) that we might
want to treat similarly (like documentation for your software, or this
lesson). The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" class="external-link">Creative Commons</a>
(CC) is a family of licenses analogous to open-source but for things
other than software. Another class of work that can fall under Creative
Commons licenses is data. Be aware that if you utilize data with a CC
BY-SA license, you may be limited in your in your licensing options as
CC BY-SA is similar to a copyleft, requiring derivative works to use the
same license. Variants of the Creative Commons license allow you to
impose various restrictions, similar to choosing different licenses for
software:</p>
<ul>
<li>CC BY (Attribution)</li>
<li>CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike)</li>
<li>CC BY-ND (Attribution-NoDerivs)</li>
<li>CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial)</li>
<li>CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike)</li>
<li>CC BY-NC-ND (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Attribution clause, which is part of all CC licenses, requires
that the user include the appropriate attribution (title, author,
source, license) when the work is used. The ShareAlike clause requires
that adaptations (derivatives) be shared under the same terms as the
original (analogous to copyleft). The NoDerivs clause says that no
derivatives of the work are permitted. The NonCommercial clause says
that only non-commercial uses of the work are permitted. Without this
clause, commercial uses are allowed.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons has developed a set of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads#badges" class="external-link">badges</a> and
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads#icons" class="external-link">icons</a>
that provide quick visual indicators of the chosen license. For example,
this lesson is licensed under CC BY 4.0: <img src="../fig/cc-by.png" style="width:50%" alt="alt text" class="figure"></p>
<p>There is also a “CC0 Public Domain Dedication” which can be used to
indicate intent to place the artifact in the public domain. However this
does not satisfy the legal requirements in all jurisdictions, so if
you’re serious about placing a work in the public domain, you might want
to investigate further.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of the most common reasons that developers of scientific software
choose open-source over proprietary licensing is because they consider
it to be consistent with the scientific method. The scientific method
requires transparency and reproducibility, and in computationally-based
science, this implies that the “apparatus” (i.e., the software) be
available for others to inspect and understand and that others should be
able to use it to reproduce the relevant (computational)
experiments.</p>
<p>Another philosophical reason that many cite is that the results of
publicly-funded research (e.g., software produced with research funding)
should be publicly available.</p>
<p>And, finally, there’s the altruistic reason that releasing the
software as open source may help others.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="other-considerations-favoring-open-source">Other considerations favoring open source<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-considerations-favoring-open-source"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Even if you’re not completely swayed by the philosophical arguments
above, there may be other, more practical reasons to lean towards
open-source licensing.</p>
<p>One very simple, but often compelling, reason is that the sponsor of
your research may require (or encourage) you to release your software
products as open source. At this point in time, many (most) U.S. federal
research sponsors are encouraging “open science” with policies that
explicitly or implicitly encourage open source. Within the U.S.
Department of Energy, several programs have adopted a <a href="https://science.osti.gov/-/media/ascr/pdf/research/docs/Doe_lab_developed_software_policy.pdf" class="external-link">policy</a>
that prefers open-source release unless there is a reason not to do
so.</p>
<p>Another common reason to favor open-source licensing is to facilitate
building a community around your software. Understandably, an open and
accessible code base is likely to be more attractive and have a lower
barrier to entry for potential contributors than closed source. On the
other hand, having to complete an explicit license agreement is a
barrier to use (or contribution) of closed-source software. At most
institutions, only a few people are authorized to sign legal agreements
on behalf of the organization. Usually, a license agreement would have
to be reviewed and executed by an IP lawyer, which can cause delays. In
some cases, the institution and the licensor may be unable to come to an
agreement on the terms and it may be impossible to obtain the
license.</p>
<p>And, on a related note, if you’re using a proprietary license, you
have to manage and archive all of the paperwork associated with those
licenses so that you know who your licenses are. Some find that this is
more trouble than it’s worth.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are also a variety of reasons that some people argue against
open-sourcing software, which don’t hold up if you dig a little
deeper.</p>

<p>It is a common misconception that open-sourcing software prevents you
from making money off of it. In fact, there are many different business
models that are commonly used around software, and nearly all of them
are as applicable to open-source as to proprietary software.</p>

<p>If you’re using a permissive license, someone else can take
derivatives proprietary. But, with the wealth of permissively licensed
software out there, this is not a common experience. If you’re still
concerned, you might prefer a copyleft license, which will prevent this
scenario.</p>
<p>But there might be other considerations at play, too. For example,
what if you <em>do</em> want a commercial entity to use your software –
for example, for it to be adopted by a computer vendor or distributed in
a Linux or similar large distribution of software? This is a way of
getting your software broader exposure and broader distribution.
Assuming you’re not expecting financial compensation, this kind of
collaboration becomes much easier with open-source licensing, and more
specifically with <em>permissive</em> licenses.</p>

<p>Many commercial entities find copyleft licenses scary. They are
concerned about how far the viral nature of copyleft licenses reaches
into other parts of their product. Legal opinions on this differ, and
that is little or no case law on this yet. Since lawyers tend towards
conservative answers, they will often advise their commercial clients to
avoid copyleft software. As a result, many companies will not consider
working with copyleft software, only permissively licensed software.
Some (typically larger) companies consider staff working on copyleft
software to be “contaminated” and will not allow them to work on other
software.</p>

</h4>
<p>“Software-as-a-service” (SaaS) is a popular way of making software
products available today. Many SaaS products make extensive use of
open-source software. Some developers don’t like the possibility that
another company can trivially monetize (other people’s) software by
turning it into a SaaS product. It may compete with the developer’s own
SaaS offering. And the SaaS provider can keep enhancements proprietary
while making the benefits available in the SaaS product.</p>
<p>Use in a SaaS product is not considered distribution of the software
per se. But some licenses, such as the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3/" class="external-link">GNU Affero General Public
License</a> include “network” clauses that require that the source be
made available to remote users of the service. Other ways of addressing
these concerns tend to result in licenses that are not open source. In
some cases, key modules are changed to proprietary licenses while others
remain open.</p>
<p>An article on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/" class="external-link">Ars Technica</a>
website discusses the SaaS conundrum further: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/is-the-software-world-taking-too-much-from-the-open-source-community/" class="external-link">In
2019, multiple open source companies changed course—is it the right

</h3>
<p>Another concern that people sometimes raise about openly accessible
code is that others can use the novel ideas embodied in it to “scoop”
them. Proprietary licenses, by their nature, allow you to keep the
source code private, so you can avoid this concern. But there are also
strategies that you can use with open source to provide functional
protection.</p>
<p>First, as we discussed earlier, open source licenses do <em>not</em>
require that you make derived works public, only that <em>if</em> you
do, you make the source available. So the basic strategy is not to
disclose your novel derived work until you’ve had a reasonable chance to
exploit the results of your work. For example, you might wait until
you’ve published the initial papers about the method and results that
might not be obtainable with other methods. Or you might give yourself
(or your team) a fixed “exploitation period” (e.g., one year) before
publishing the source code. This is similar to a compromise that’s often
used in academic publishing, where a sponsor wants the publications to
be open access, but they allow the publisher a proprietary exploitation
period (also often one year) before making the document openly
available.</p>

<p>Open-source is a great tool to help you build a community around your

want to build a community that contributes to and helps support your

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>If you want to use an open-source license with your software, the
first advice is to use an existing license rather than inventing your
own. The OSI has approved more than 80 different licenses as qualifying
as open source. They cover a wide range of situations, and with that
many options, you’re pretty unlikely to have a need that’s not already
covered. Moreover, the OSI feels that there are too many open-source
licenses already, and has been reluctant to review and approve new
licenses to control the proliferation.</p>
<p>Another reason to choose an OSI-approved license is that there are
some publication venues (e.g., the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/" class="external-link">Journal of Open Source Software</a>
(JOSS)) that will only accept OSI-approved licenses. There is at least
one case in which JOSS rejected a submission for a software package that
was licensed under an institution-specific variant of the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause/" class="external-link">3-Clause BSD
License</a> which was not OSI-approved. While there are other options
besides JOSS for publishing your software, it is important to be aware
of such restrictions when selecting a license.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="considerations-in-selecting-an-open-source-license">Considerations in selecting an open-source license<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#considerations-in-selecting-an-open-source-license"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The most significant decision in open-source is between permissive or
copyleft licenses. Technically, this is a decision as to whether
derivative works can be changed to a new license or not. But it can have
knock-on effects, particularly in the area of license compatibility.</p>
<p>License compatibility comes into play when you start combining
software to get your work done. As we discussed earlier, there are
different interpretations of what kinds of combinations do or do not
result in derived works which, under copyleft licensing, might become
subject to the terms of the original work’s license. Permissive licenses
have fewer compatibility issues.</p>
<p>On a related note, it is worth considering the norms of the community
you and your software are engaging with. If, for example, “everyone” in
your field uses a particular license, it may be easier for your software
to be accepted by others if you follow the same approach – unless, of
course, you have strong reasons for doing otherwise.</p>
<p>Another clause that appears in many open-source licenses has to do
with the labeling of derived works, requiring that derived works be
identified differently than the original. Why would we want this? What
if someone took your code, and in modifying it introduced a bug that
made all of the results it produced subtly wrong? That could easily give
your code a bad name – unless the problem code had a <em>different</em>
name that enabled the community to easily distinguish them.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="patents-in-software-licenses">Patents in software licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#patents-in-software-licenses"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A patent is a different form of intellectual property than a creative
work like a piece of software. But they are often connected in the
software, and increasingly software licenses also include patent-related
clauses.</p>
<p>Patents cover an invention that is useful and non-obvious. That
invention could be embodied in software. Some people make strong
arguments against the idea that inventions embodied in software should
be patentable at all. But in the legal sense, they are a reality. If
you’re using a piece of software (even open source) that is covered by a
patent and you don’t have a license for the patent, you’re infringing.
Not being aware of the patent does not excuse the infringement. And you
could be sued for monetary damages.</p>
<p>Historically, many open-source licenses were silent on patents – they
said nothing at all about them. More recently, since the courts have
decided that software inventions are patentable, some open-source
licenses have started including patent-related clauses.</p>
<p>The most common type of patent clause grants royalty-free (i.e. no
cost) right to use patented content owned by the copyright holder(s)
(e.g. <a href="https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/" class="external-link">Apache
2.0</a>, <a href="https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0/" class="external-link">GPLv3</a>).
(Obviously, the copyright holders can’t provide licenses for other
people’s patents – which is important to remember. It is still possible
that a code has (presumably unknowingly) infringed on some other
patent.) Another form of patent clause involves retaliation, effectively
saying “If you sue me for patent infringement, your license to use this
software is terminated”, (e.g. <a href="https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/" class="external-link">Apache 2.0</a>). A
weak retaliation clause is triggered by an action related to the
specific software, whereas a strong retaliation clause is triggered by
any patent action against the licensor.</p>
<p>Although it is no longer listed by the OSI, there is also a <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause-clear/" class="external-link">BSD
3-Clause Clear License</a> which explicitly states that no patent rights
are granted by the license.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are, in essence, two strategies for indicating your choice of
license. The first is to put it in a file at the repository level. The
second is to put it inside the individual files. The centralized
approach has the advantage of simplicity and maintainability. However,
if an individual file is separated from the distribution or repository,
the recipient won’t see the copyright and license information if the
notice only appears in a central file.</p>

<p>Have you ever received a file by itself, outside of the context of a
version control repository or complete distribution of the package, for
example as a potential solution to a problem or a bug? Was the origin of
the file and its copyright and licensing evident to you? Or perhaps the
person who gave it to you told you about the license and copyright
terms?</p>
<p>Did that file (or parts of it) end up in another software package
that you were working on at the time?</p>

<p>You should place the complete copyright information together with the
text of the license you’ve chosen in a prominent location in the main
directory of your repository. In the past <code>COPYING</code> used to
be a popular recommendation for this file, but <code>LICENSE</code>
seems like a more obvious choice and is probably more commonly used
these days.</p>
<p>If your package is more complicated, with multiple licenses, they can
often naturally be grouped into subdirectories with consistent licensing
and each subdirectory can include an appropriate <code>LICENSE</code>
file. If the licensing structure is sufficiently complex, it may be
worth placing a “roadmap” to the various licenses applying to different
parts of the code in the top directory.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="tracking-authorship-and-copyright-information">Tracking authorship and copyright information<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tracking-authorship-and-copyright-information"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Every person who makes a non-trivial contribution to a software
package has a copyright interest in that package. (There’s no legal
definition for what constitutes a non-trivial contribution. The package
maintainers need to determine that on a case by case basis. Fixing a
typo, or even perhaps a simple bug fix may not be considered
substantive. But a complex bug fix or implementing new functionality
probably would be.) Such a list can get rather long and could change
frequently as new contributors join. (Though if many of the contributors
are performing work for hire and their employers actually own the
copyright, the list of rightsholders may not be so long after all.) But
it is important to maintain this information to the best of your ability
to ensure that contributors get the credit they deserve and contributors
can be identified if legal issues arise.</p>
<p>If used carefully, version control systems provide a good means to
track authorship. But you need to use the version control tools in such
a way that maintains the file histories as files are moved, renamed,
etc. In other words, instead of changing the name of a file by
<code>git rm</code>ing the old name and <code>git add</code>ing the new
name, use <code>git mv</code> so that the history (of commits and the
authorship of those commits) follows the file through the name
change.</p>
<p>But this authoritative information about authorship is only available
in the version control repository, using your version control tool. If
the package is bundled up and distributed as a tarball, or in some other
form outside of the repository, this information may be inaccessible to
the recipient. The same is true for individual files which might be
distributed outside of the package for various reasons.</p>
<p>So the recommendation is to construct a copyright notice for the
entire repository (as opposed to for each individual file), and try to
do a reasonable job of keeping it up to date. The most likely place for
the copyright notice to live is in your <code>LICENSE</code> file
because the license normally includes a copyright notice. But another
option, if you prefer, could be a separate <code>COPYRIGHT</code> or
<code>AUTHORS</code> file. Note, however, that the copyright holders are
not necessarily the authors of the code, depending on whether the
authors or their employers are the rightsholders.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As a point of reference, the recommendation of the FSF is to include
the following in the header (beginning) of <em>every</em> file in the
package:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>one sentence naming and briefly describing the program,</li>
<li>the copyright notice of the authors,</li>
<li>the name(s) of the license(s) under which the software is
available,</li>
<li>a brief warranty disclaimer, and</li>
<li>a URL pointing to the full copy of the license.</li>
</ol>
<p>Others recommend including the full text of the license rather than
just the name and a URL. This is a lot of information to insert into
every file and a lot of information to maintain. Note that the
contributors to each individual file are likely to be different, so in
principle, each file could have a <em>different</em> copyright notice,
each of which would need to be maintained. All of which seems a little
overboard for most purposes.</p>
<p>The SFLC’s suggestion is to boil the per-file header down to the
essentials. You want enough information that if the file was distributed
separately from the rest of the repository, the recipient could identify
the origins of the file and know where to look for the remaining
details. Something along the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>Copyright 2012 The Foo Project Developers. See the LICENSE file at the top-level directory of this distribution and at https://www.example.com/foo/LICENSE.

This file is part of Foo Project. It is subject to the license terms in the LICENSE file found in the top-level directory of this distribution and at https://www.example.com/foo/LICENSE. No part of Foo Project, including this file, may be copied, modified, propagated, or distributed except according to the terms contained in the LICENSE file.</code></pre>
<p>Consider writing scripts to help you insert and maintain the
file-scope copyright and license headers you decide upon.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Badges at the top of <code>README.md</code> files are a popular way
to summarize a variety of information about the software package. Such
badges often include testing status and other dynamic information.
Licenses are pretty static, so it may be more and so more fun than
functional, but badges are available to reflect many popular
licenses.</p>
<p>The badge generation site <a href="https://shields.io" class="external-link uri">https://shields.io</a> can automatically render a badge for
any license that GitHub recognizes by simply referencing the repository
as follows:</p>
<pre><code>![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/:user/:repo){alt='alt text'}</code></pre>
<p>for example,
<code>![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/hpc-simtools/ips-framework)</code>
which renders as <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/license/hpc-simtools/ips-framework" alt="alt text" class="figure"></p>
<p>The site also provides many license badges which can be selected
explicitly, such as the badge for this lesson:
<code>[![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</code>
which renders as <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY_4.0-lightgrey.svg" alt="alt text" class="figure">(<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" class="external-link uri">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a>)</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://shields.io" class="external-link">shields.io</a> site lists many
licenses directly, a developer named <a href="https://gist.github.com/lukas-h" class="external-link">Lukas Himsel</a> has posted a <a href="https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba" class="external-link">Gist</a>

<p>If you are lucky, you have an open-source project with an active user
base and a few developers to help field issues. As a project grows, it’s
possible you will get pull requests from people you’ve never met. Even
if the code looks great, it’s possible the has author inadvertently has
caused a licensing issue.</p>
<p>A somewhat related topic is how to handle code snippets from external
sources like web forums or large language models.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="contributors-and-licenses">Contributors and Licenses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#contributors-and-licenses"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are two cases where a contributor can cause problems with
licensing your code.</p>
<p>First, if you have a copyleft license, contributors from industry may
be reluctant to contribute over fear of accidentally violating the terms
of the GPL license. Since GPL requires derivative works to be copyleft,
if the contributor were to incorporate some of the code into a larger
project, they would be obligated to release the entire code base under
the license terms.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have a restrictive license, it’s possible a
contribution may not be subject to copyright at all! Any work from a
government employee, say a researcher at a federal agency, is not
subject to copyright and is in public domain.</p>
<p>It is important to communicate your license terms to all
collaborators and decide on a license early in a project’s life cycle.
Changing a license is possible, but may require the explicit approval of
all contributors; for larger, older projects the prospect is
daunting.</p>
<p>Part of being proactive is developing and publishing your
CONTRIBUTING guidelines. You can also choose to use a Contributor
License Agreement (CLA), which is a legal document that new contributors
must sign prior to merging their code. While protective of the software
project, CLAs may limit inclusivity by acting as a barrier to first time
contributors. They can also create a power imbalance between maintainers
and contributors. Practically, CLAs often require review and approval by
the legal department of the contributor.</p>
<p>A Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lighter agreement that
allows contributors to confirm the code they commit is suitable for the
project license. They can be integrated into a PR or commit message
instead of a separate legal document. In either case, the policies for
contributors should be clear and easy to find and verify if legal issues
do arise.</p>

</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="code-from-internet-forums">Code from internet forums<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-from-internet-forums"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Question and answer forums like stackoverflow provide a valuable
avenue for developers to connect with knowledgeable users covering a
range of topics from installation, language usage, and debugging. It is
satisfying to find the exact answer to your problem so you can get back
to work, but how can you integrate the answer in accordance with the
license agreement of the forum?</p>
<p>The best case is to take the answer and distill it to your
application. Say you are searching for how to plot a scatter plot with
transparency given by another column in your dataframe. An answer may
suggest matplotlib, seaborn, or another plotting library. When you
integrate the answer into your code, you will have to modify the answer
to fit your variables and when finally put in place, the one line could
have come directly from the documentation. Ideally you would use the
suggested answer to further research the documentation and develop a
distinct call. In this case, you are using an internet forum as a
shortcut to library documentation. You don’t have to disclose where the
original idea came from, but for your own benefit it is a good idea to
include the URL in a comment.</p>
<p>But what if you are searching for something like a binary search
written in python, or the answer contains a function snippet for
performing the task you need? Fair use does not use length as a factor,
if you directly copy and paste code and you want to distribute that
code, it would then fall under the original license, for stackoverflow,
that is CC-BY-SA.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A recent development for software engineers is the rise of large
language models capable of producing code from English descriptions. The
utilities are integrated in many search engines, IDEs, or as standalone
assistants. While performance and utility can vary wildly, LLMs can
increase developer productivity by removing some of the tedious jobs.
Just be wary, correct-seeming code can be worse than something clearly
wrong!</p>
<p>Just as the technological limits of LLMs are still being discovered,
the legal aspect of AI and licenses are actively being determined in
court. There are three phases where licensing and copyright concerns
appear in utilizing LLMs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>During training, what code has been ingested? How do the licenses of
the code affect what is produced?</li>
<li>If you want to refine an LLM, what license is the model distributed
with?</li>
<li>If I use code generate by an LLM, what attribution does it need and
will it affect my license?</li>
</ol>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="ingested-code">Ingested code<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ingested-code"></a>
</h3>
<p>Unless you are training your own LLM, this is more of an interesting
case study in copyright than a day-to-day concern. Since the
implementation details of many LLMs are proprietary, you may not know
what code a model was trained on, what license the code used, or if
permission was attained to use the software for training.</p>
<p>Legal challenges against AI companies have been brought up by artists
and authors, who allege the generation of verbatim passages or
replication of artistic style indicate training data included
copyrighted material against the creators wishes. Code generation hasn’t
been included in these lawsuits so far, but rulings on other domains
could affect how LLMs are trained. If you are concerned about the origin
of code used to train an LLM, look for LLMs that provide information on
the training set and uses a training set aligned with your license and
values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="refining-an-llm">Refining an LLM<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#refining-an-llm"></a>
</h3>
<p>Refining a published network is somewhat straight forward! Just like
any other piece of software, you can follow the license distributed with
the material in creating derived works from the original network.
However, the weights of the foundation model could “contain” copyrighted
material from data on which they were trained. It’s possible that during
refinement, the network will retain the copyright material in a form
that can be recovered. Litigation will be needed to sort out fair use,
but keep in mind that refined networks may contain the foundation model
largely unchanged.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="using-code-from-llms">Using code from LLMs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-code-from-llms"></a>
</h3>
<p>You may have already used code from an LLM, either to play with a new
technology or even in production to save time on development. Continuing
with the theme of this section, we don’t know all the answers until
legislation and lawsuits settle.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario, you use an LLM to generate a
function that is later discovered to be verbatim from a copyrighted code
base, violating the license. Are you liable for damages, the company
that trained the network, or the company you pay to use the LLM? Due to
the difficulties with tracking down what input data has contributed to
LLM output, you may be the most likely party targeted for damages.</p>
<p>Some tools have been developed to scan LLM output to flag large
snippets which are present in other sources. Many tech companies don’t
allow code generation from outside products due to privacy concerns, as
well as licensing issues. Keep in mind if you are interested in industry
that reliance on an LLM for code generation is probably not a good
strategy.</p>
<p>The US government recently declared that AI generated work can not be
copyrighted if it’s produced without human intervention beyond prompt
engineering. This is likely to apply to a work as a whole instead of
snippets, e.g. if your project has a few generated functions it could
still have a copyright. If instead you instruct an LLM to “make a game”
(and it’s able to do so), that could would not be copyrighted. As an
example, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/docs/zarya-of-the-dawn.pdf" class="external-link">“Zaraya of
the Dawn”</a> is a comic book where the images were produced by
Midjourney. While the text and layout were human generated and therefore
subject to copyright, the US Copyright Office found the images could not
be copyrighted. Extending this to software, if you have AI produce all
of your UI, that portion of your code could be public domain.</p>
<p>If you are developing code you intend to monetize, the safest advice
would be to avoid LLM snippets altogether. Were it brought to light in
discovery, AI-generated code could open the door to damages over the
entire code base. Otherwise, treat LLM output like code from an internet
forum, you can use it for information and to point you towards a library
call, but don’t copy its entire output. If you do copy and paste code,
you may also want to mark in the source code what is LLM-derived. Doing
this consistently could safeguard parts of your project that may
resemble proprietary code by chance.</p>
